# SegmaPatron-A-Customer-Segmentation-System
A solid segmentation strategy is key for differentiating you from your competition. Customer Segmentation is a popular application of unsupervised learning. Using clustering, companies can identify segments of customers to target the potential user base. They need to divide customers into groups according to common characteristics like gender, age, interests, and spending habits so they can market to each group effectively. This project will approach customer segmentation with three different algorithms.: K-means, Hierarchical clustering by Agglomerative approach, and DBSCAN Clustering. The same dataset is fed to all three algorithms and their results are compared and analyzed.
